      <p>To summaarize, this project sought to shed light on some of the key concerns of Digital Archaeology at this point in time. Even now, it is not entirely clear what Digital Archaeology is as a discipline, and it is even less clear what it will be even a few years down the road. Nevertheless, some valuable insights can be made when one explores the technology, method and theory, and ethics currently facing digital archaeologists.</p>
      
      <p>From web platforms to virtual reality, technology has transformed the face of archaeology and arguably made Digital Archaeology into its own, unique entity. While we cannot know the exact trajectory of technology in upcoming years, the issues that Digital Archaeology seems to be focusing on, including visualisation, interpretation, and preservation, may inform some predictions.</p>
      
      <p>To gain further insight into the potential route technology will take, one can turn the the method and theory of Digital Archaeology. The approach of archaeologists to digitization, the nature of data for methodology, and the impact of the digital world on theory, Digital Archaeology is both being informed by and informing the aims and practices of the discipline, and digital archaeologists will play a key role in this process.</p>
      
      <p>As a result of new technologies and changing methods and theories, ethics will continue to play an important role in the future of Digital Archaeology. A clear, ethical code for Digital Archaeology is essential, and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later that archaeologists decide to explore guidelines and policies more in-depth, for the sake of archaeologists, the public, and archaeology as a whole.</p>
      
      
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

<p>At this point in time, Digital Archaeology is still a fairly young field, but it is rapidly becoming a significant part of the archaeological world. Thus, we are left with many questions regarding the future of this discipline. While these questions cannot be answered here, it is still worth raising these questions. Even though there may not be any definitive answers at all, by simply bringing these questions into the spotlight and encouraging discussions on them, Digital Archaeology will benefit greatly in the long run. It can be difficult to accurately and entirely answer what Digital Archaeology is, but by starting a dialogue the direction and future concerns of the discipline may become clearer.</p>

      <h4>Is Digital Archaeology its own discipline?</h4>
      
      <p>Before much more can be done to explore dimensions of Digital Archaeology, it will be important for archaeologists to define what it is exactly. Is it its own discipline? Is it a component of mainstream archaeology? Or, in our increasingly technological and digital world, is Digital Archaeology simply the future of mainstream archaeology itself? Indeed, the answer to this question may not ever be answerable, but it is important for archaeologists to pose such questions in order to understand what it is they are doing and how Digital Archaeology can best serve society.</p>
      
      <h4>Can Digital Archaeology be entertaining and popular while still maintaining its integrity?</h4>
      
      <p>As the “serious academic” demonstrates, it is important to maintain integrity in disciplines like archaeology and ensure the trends of the digital world do not override the integrity of the discipline. However, there are many benefits offered by technology and there will likely be many more in the future, so it is important for archaeologists to find the best way to accommodate both education and entertainment before one or the other possibly overshadows the other.</p>
      
      <h4>How will method and theory change?</h4>
      
      <p>This may be the hardest question to answer, and yet it may also be the most important. Method and theory are essential features for understanding how a discipline operates and how it is serving academia and the public. Without considering how and why research is taking place, archaeologists will find themselves struggling to define what it is they are trying to achieve with Digital Archaeology. Without a proper understanding of what they hope to achieve, archaeologists will have difficulty figuring out the means to achieve it, and vice versa.</p>
      
      <h4>Where are the ethics?</h4>
      
      <p>Just as technology, method, and theory are crucial in defining what Digital Archaeology is, ethics also play a key role in outlining its fundamental nature. Ethics are not only essential in traditional archaeology, but in all academic disciplines. Without providing ethical guidelines and policies for the specific issues of Digital Archaeology, problems may arise in the future. Ethics provide responsibility and protection within a discipline, as well as establish the core principles of that discipline. Ethics are beginning to gain more attention, but archaeologists must place an even greater emphasis Digital Archaeology’s specific ethical issues or risk serious problems down the road.</p>
      
      <p>Clearly, these are big questions that cannot be entirely answered in one simple project like this; however, the ideas and information discussed here will hopefully contribute to ongoing discussions of Digital Archaeology. Eventually some of these questions may be answerable, but for now it is important to simply begin the dialogue and figure out what it is exactly that must be addressed. As the world continues to change technologically, culturally, and socially, these concerns will remain very important for archaeologists, especially as we continue to push-on into the digital age.</p>
