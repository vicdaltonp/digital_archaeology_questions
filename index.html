<p>At this point in time, Digital Archaeology is still a fairly young field, but it is rapidly becoming a significant, and arguably essential, component of traditional archaeology. Thus, we are left with many questions regarding the future of this discipline. While these questions cannot be answered here, it is still worth raising these questions. Even though there may not be any definitive answers at all, by simply bringing these questions into the spotlight and encouraging discussions on them, Digital Archaeology will benefit greatly in the long run. It can be difficult to accurately and entirely answer what Digital Archaeology is, but by exploring questions like these, the direction and future concerns of the discipline may become clearer.</p>

      <h4>Is Digital Archaeology its own discipline?</h4>
      
      <p>Before much more can be done to explore dimensions of Digital Archaeology, it will be important for archaeologists to define what it is exactly. Is it its own discipline? Is it a component of mainstream archaeology? Or, in our increasingly technological and digital world, is Digital Archaeology simply the future of archaeology in general? Indeed, the answer to this question may not ever be answerable; however, it is important for archaeologists to pose such questions in order to understand what it is that they are doing and how Digital Archaeology can best serve society.</p>
      
      <h4>Can Digital Archaeology be entertaining and popular while still maintaining its integrity?</h4>
      
      <p>As the “serious academic” demonstrates, it is important to maintain integrity in disciplines like archaeology and ensure the trends of the digital world do not override the integrity of the discipline. However, there are many benefits offered by technology and there will likely be many more in the future, so it is important for archaeologists to find the best way to accommodate both education and entertainment before one or the other potentially overshadows the other.</p>
      
      <h4>How will method and theory change?</h4>
      
      <p>This may be the hardest question to answer, and yet it may also be the most important. Method and theory are essential components for understanding how a discipline operates and how it is serving academia and the public. Without considering how and why research is taking place, archaeologists will find themselves struggling to define what it is they are trying to achieve with Digital Archaeology. Without a proper understanding of what they hope to achieve, archaeologists will have difficulty figuring out the means to achieve it, and vice versa.</p>
      
      <h4>Where are the ethics?</h4>
      
      <p>Just as technology, method, and theory are crucial in defining what Digital Archaeology is, ethics also play a key role in outlining its fundamental nature. Ethics are not only essential in traditional archaeology, but in all academic disciplines. Without providing ethical guidelines and policies for the specific issues of Digital Archaeology, problems may occur in the future. Ethics provide responsibility and protection within a discipline, as well as establish the core principles of that discipline. Ethics are beginning to gain more attention, but archaeologists must place an even greater emphasis Digital Archaeology’s specific ethical issues or risk serious challenges down the road.</p>
      
      <p>Clearly, these are big questions that cannot be entirely answered in one simple project like this; however, hopefully the ideas and information discussed here will contribute to ongoing discussions of Digital Archaeology. Eventually some of these questions may be answerable, but for now it is important to simply begin the dialogue and figure out what it is exactly that must be addressed as the world continues to change technologically, culturally, and socially. These have always been concerns for archaeologists, and in the digital age they remain no less important.</p>
